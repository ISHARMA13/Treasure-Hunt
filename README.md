# Treasure-Hunt
 It is a game made using the C - programming language. It is quite similar to Minesweeper. BUT, there's a catch.
 
 _Along with **avoiding the mines** in the minefield, you are to **reach** the **Hidden** treasure, a box full of **Gold coins**._
 
 Since, the game was made using the graphics header file, the graphics may not be up to the mark. 
 
 **BUT, CAN YOU REACH LEVEL 15??**

Good luck!
